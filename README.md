# Curl RAG Chat Application

This is a simple chat application integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. It allows users to create chat sessions, send messages, and receive responses generated by the RAG model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- PHP (version compatible with your Laravel project, e.g., >= 8.1)
- Composer
- A web server like Apache or Nginx (though Laravel's built-in server is fine for development)
- A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) if your application uses a database.

**Note:** This project uses plain HTML for the frontend and does not require Node.js or npm for installation or running.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/debjit/http-rag
    cd http-rag
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies using Composer:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Copy the environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Generate an application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Configure your `.env` file:**
    Open the `.env` file and update the database credentials (`DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc.) and any other environment-specific settings.

6.  **Run database migrations (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

## Running the Application

You can serve the application using Laravel's built-in development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  Click on the "Curl Rag Chat" button to start a new chat. This will take you to a "Create New Chat" page.
3.  Optionally, enter a title for your chat and click "Create Chat".
4.  You will be redirected to the chat interface. Type your message in the input field and click "Send Message".
5.  The RAG model will process your message and provide a response, which will appear in the chat.
6.  You can view all your chats by clicking on the "Chats" link in the navigation bar. From there, you can view, edit, or delete existing chats.

## Setup

To set up the project, you need to populate the environment variables with values such as the Qdrant URL, OpenAI-compatible base URL, and other required variables. You can find them in the `.env.example` file.

  Creates a collection/database.
  **Command:** `php artisan qdrant:create-collection`

* `App\Console\Commands\PopulateQdrantWithBooks`
  Populates the database with 30 sample books to help you test the repository.
